## HTML ATTRIBUTES

<p>These are properties of HTML elements that affect the behaviours of any particular element, or gives descriptive information about the element, to the browser.</p>
It usually is in the form of <b>name/value</b> like <strong>name=”value”</strong>

<p>Take for example the styling of some HTML elements like paragraph <b>P</b>, or the property in the anchor tag <strong>a</strong> to tell the browser which web address to navigate to.</p>

<p>We can also consider the HTML image element, which we can specify the attribute that tells the browser what image to display.</p>
<p>For specifying the values of HTML attributes, we can use either single or double quotes. However, its more conventional to find web designers using double quotes. It doesn’t’ really matter to the browser whether you decide to use single or double quotes. But whatever style you choose to adopt, try to be consistent with it.</p>
<p>HTML attributes is a something we would continue revisiting as we look at other commonly used HTML elements.</p>
