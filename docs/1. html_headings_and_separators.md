## HTML Headings

## HTML Separators :: Paragraphs &lt;p&gt;, Line breaks &lt;br/&gt;, Horizontal lines &lt;hr/&gt;

<p>Separator elements are used to isolate content bits of HTML elements. Some common Separator elements include Paragraphs, Line breaks and Horizontal lines.</p>

Lets look at them:<br/>
><p><em  style='color:yellow;font-weight:bold'>PARAGRAPHS</em>: They are used to define a block of text. This block of text is displayed i the browser with some marginal space appended to both the beginning/start and end of the paragraph.</p>
><p><i style='color:yellow;font-weight:bold'>BREAK</i>: This sends the cursor to the next line of the webpage. This is equivalent to when you make a line break in Microsoft word by pressing the Enter key.</p>
><p><em  style='color:yellow;font-weight:bold'>Horizontal Lines</em>: These are just used as separators or rather demarcaters. They are displayed in the space that they occupy.</p>
